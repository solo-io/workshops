# Introduction

To make sure anyone can easily perform the different tasks, we have provisioned a Virtual Machine for each of you.

You'll be able to deploy several Kubernetes clusters on this machine using _Kind_.

_MetalLB_ has been deployed to expose the Load Balancer services you'll create on your Kubernetes clusters.

All the prerequisites have already been deployed on your machine.

## Prerequisites

You will be accessing your Virtual Machine using [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/).

Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway. Thanks to HTML5, once Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.

## Access your virtual machine

Log into your Virtual Machine using your web browser.

The URL is `http://<ip address provided by the instructor>/guacamole/`

The user is `solo` and the password is `Workshop1#`
