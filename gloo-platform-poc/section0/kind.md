# Kind

You may use Kind for this POC if you don't have access to an alternative platform/cloud provider Kubernetes. We recommend using a platform that can leverage LoadBalancers to expose Kubernetes services and when using Kind we recommend metallb.

{% hint style="info" %}
NodePort should work well too. We will capture NodePort scenarios in this POC document.

## Setting up Kind using Workshop scripts

In the [Solo.io workshop material](https://workshops.solo.io/gloo-workshops/), we have [scripts to help you quickly deploy clusters](https://github.com/solo-io/workshops/tree/master/scripts) for testing purposes. We will use those scripts for setting up Kind in this section, but you may customize/use your own as you see fit.

Using the following command lines from the $ROOT\_DIR of the workshops, you can spin up two Kubernetes clusters using Kind that have metallb installed \(used for LoadBalancers\):

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh 1 gloo-mesh-1 us-west us-west-1
./scripts/deploy.sh 2 gloo-mesh-2 us-east us-east-1

echo "pause for clusters"
sleep 5s

kubectl config set-context gloo-mesh-1
```

You can check the status of these clusters with the following:

```bash
./scripts/check.sh gloo-mesh-1 
./scripts/check.sh gloo-mesh-2
```

Note that we've named our Kubernetes clusters `gloo-mesh-1` and `gloo-mesh-2`. The name of the Kubernetes contexts are the same as the cluster names:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

## Setting up Kind yourself

You are free to set up Kind yourself and customize the Kubernetes bootstrap yourself. Please refer to the `deploy.sh` script in the $ROOT\_DIR/scripts folder for more detail about how the clusters are set up and you can modify accordingly.
