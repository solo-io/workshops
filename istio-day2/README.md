# Istio Day 2 Series

[Istio](https://istio.io) is the most popular service mesh deployed into production across the cloud-native ecosystem, and for good reason. Itâ€™s feature rich, open-source, and most importantly battle proven. It provides the foundational pieces to implement zero-trust networking, get deeper observability into a distributed system, and smart routing control for safer software releases.

## Workshop details

This workshop series is for those looking to learn more about how Istio works and how to operationalize it for their organization. We cover things like the basics of routing, observability, and security, and then expand into leveraging Istio for a devops/gitops CI/CD flow, zero-downtime upgrades of Istio control plane, plugging in with existing PKI, and running Istio on VMs and across multiple clusters. The lessons from this workshop have been cultivated by working with large and small organizations across the world adopting Istio.

The workshop series is broken up into separate workshops:

* [Deploy Istio for Production](1-deploy-istio/)
* [Operationalizing Istio for Day-2](2-operate-istio.md)
* :construction: Istio for zero-trust networking \(WIP\)

## Workshop delivery options

The workshop materials were prepared with self-paced as well as live-delivery modes in mind. You are free to follow the guides on your end on your own Kubernetes cluster.
